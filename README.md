This program is built to multiply 2 8 bit numbers together using booths algorithm. 
The program takes two integers and converts them into their binary and then performs the algorithm on them.

There should be the capability to multiply larger number than just two 8 bit integers by changing the BITS variable at the top of the file.
    This has not been tested yet.
